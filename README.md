Degen Edition
Outsmart the Urge. Protect the Stack. Learn Your Patterns.

A behavioral awareness and financial empowerment tool designed for gamblers who want to avoid the "rinse" cycle (i.e., hitting $0 balance) while still enjoying the game. Originally built as Mischief Manager to help users control impulse spending (think: ADHD-friendly budget boundaries, impulse tracking), this edition applies the same philosophy to gambling without restricting the player from playing.

Soft warnings when you're going above typical thresholds
Option to reflect, not restrict — keep the user fully in control

    Behavioral Pattern Learning

Trends around previous rinse events are tracked for personal awareness
Suggests user-defined goals or reminders, never locks access


This isn’t about telling people they can't play. It’s about helping them understand how they play — building awareness, strengthening self-trust, and turning impulsive habits into intentional ones.
