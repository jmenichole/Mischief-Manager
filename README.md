Degen Edition
Outsmart the Urge. Protect the Stack. Learn Your Patterns.

A behavioral awareness and financial empowerment tool designed for gamblers who want to avoid the "rinse" cycle (i.e., hitting $0 balance) while still enjoying the game. Originally built as Mischief Manager to help users control impulse spending (think: ADHD-friendly budget boundaries, impulse tracking), this edition applies the same philosophy to gambling without restricting the player from playing.

This isn’t about telling people they can't play. It’s about helping them understand how they play — building awareness, strengthening self-trust, and turning impulsive habits into intentional ones.
